What is ethers.io?
******************

The **ethers.io** system is a collection of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and server-side
components which aim to simplify development, deployment and sharing of **Ethereum**
applications.

The **ethers.io** system can be accessed from our own shared instance at `ethers.io`_
(or `testnet.ethers.io`_) or you can deploy your own full-stack on your own servers
(instructions for this will be coming soon).

The code is open source under the `MIT license`_ and `available on GitHub`_.
