Roll Your Own
*************

Create your own full ethers.io stack.

Advantages:

- Can use your own domain name (although, this is coming soon)
- Control all the code yourself

Disadvantages:

- Have to host your own code
- Users will need to maintain, and re-upload accounts, even if they already use ethers.io
