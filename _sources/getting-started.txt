What is ethers.io
=================

The ethers.io ecosystem is an Ethereum wallet which can load other websites and applications (dapps) securely, allowing only very restricted access. The private keys never leave your browser, and all the necessary cryptography required to operate on the Ethereum network is done right inside your browser using JavaScript.

Bullet Points:
- Securely sandboxes other dapps
- No information is ever sent to any server

====================

- Open source and avalable for open auditting and review
- Easy to leave the platform for users and developers if they lose (or never had) faith in ethers.io
- Easy to move from ethers.io from other industry standard systems
- Easy to integrate into ethers.io or deploy your own full-stack of ethers.io and host it all yourself
