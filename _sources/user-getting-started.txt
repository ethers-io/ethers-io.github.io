Getting Started
***************

Please note this documentation is a work-in-progress.

What is ethers.io
=================

The ethers.io ecosystem is an Ethereum wallet which can load other websites and
applications (dapps) securely, allowing only very restricted access. The private
keys never leave your browser, and all the necessary cryptography required to
operate on the Ethereum network is done right inside your browser using JavaScript.

Bullet Points:
- Securely sandboxes other dapps
- No information is ever sent to any server (regarding usage)


Interface Overview
==================

Place screenshot of ether.io here...

:1. Activity: This indicates when a new block is mined
:2. Interface: This is the primary interaction area for ethers.io
:3. Application: The current application you are running
:4. Status: Location of the current Application
:5. Management: Create, import, rename, download and delete accounts


Passwords
=========

**Only enter your password in this UI in the top Wallet, that looks like:**



Do **NOT** share your password with **ANYONE** (we will **NEVER** ask a user for their password).

Do **NOT** forget your password.

Keep your password **SAFE**. It is mathimatically **IMPOSSIBLE** for anyone
to recover a forgotten password, and it **CANNOT** be reset.


First Account
=============

The first time you use ethers.io, the top UI will present you with the two options:

- **Create** New Account
- **Import** existing JSON Wallet


Creating a New Account
======================

Importing an existing JSON Wallet
=================================

You may have a wallet file already, perhaps from geth or the crowdsale. You can
continue using this wallet in ethers.io.

Select "Import Wallet" from the gear in the bottom-right corner.

Using the Wallet
================

Running Your First Application
==============================

Searching and Installing Applications
=====================================


Goals (better word?)
====================

- Open source and avalable for open auditting and review
- Easy to leave the platform for users and developers if they lose (or never had) faith in ethers.io
- Easy to move to or from ethers.io from other industry standard systems
- Easy to integrate into ethers.io or deploy your own full-stack of ethers.io and host it all yourself
- Very small, very simple core. All additional functionality can be added as applications. (less than 200KB)
